# Building with responsive design

A clone of The Odin Project built with our own framework

[Demo](https://raw.githack.com/fedgut/web_framework/create_framework/styles_display.html)

# Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Personal Framework

# Using the Framework

- The framework separates CSS files according to function:
  -cssreset.css to homologate style irrespective of browser
  -layout.css has general containers
  -grid.css has the grid elements and classes
  -style.css has padding, margins, borders and other stylistic choices that dont change layout
  -All this diferent stylesheets are already linked in the html_template.html file, use it as a starting point for your projects
- assets and css folders are exclusive to the framework files, project assets should be stored in p_assets
- to use icon fonts you must link the font stylesheet as in any other font
